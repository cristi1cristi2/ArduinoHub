# ArduinoHub
A desktop app I made that I intended to be an Arduino project manager, developed for a uni project. The GUI was made with using C# Windows Forms. Server side I used Java Spring and for the database I used Postgresql. Kinda new to GitHub and i dont really know what files i should upload to github but i hope all the code is here.
